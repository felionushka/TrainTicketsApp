Train Tickets App

It is a WPF application was created as a course work to show my skills of creating database and using it in programm. 
This programm allows you to create new tickets, return existing and delete them from database. To use this app you do not
need special skills in Transact-SQL. Realisation SQL-queries was made by using Entity Framework.
The interface is simple - there are 4 windows. 
First one - Authorisation window, where you need to enter login and password to continue work with program.
Second - main window, where you can search tickets for future buying or go to third window for returning ticket.
Third one - returning ticket window, where you need to enter client's surname to find his bought tickets, then
choose one and press "Return ticket" button. It will be deleted from sold tickets and be able for clients again.
Fourth ticket - window, where you are fihishing creating new ticket for client. You will go here after pressing
"Create ticket" button on the second window. Here you will need to enter client's data and after pressing one more
button, ticket will be added to the database and become unavailable for other clients.
